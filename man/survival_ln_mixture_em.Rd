\method{survival_ln_mixture_em}{default}(formula, ...)

\method{survival_ln_mixture_em}{formula}(formula, data, intercept = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the outcome terms on the left-hand side,
and the predictor terms on the right-hand side. The outcome must be a \link[survival:Surv]{survival::Surv}
object.}

\item{data}{A \strong{data frame} containing both the predictors and the outcome.}

\item{intercept}{A logical. Should an intercept be included in the processed data?}

\item{iter}{A positive integer specifying the number of iterations for the EM algorithm.}

\item{mixture_components}{number of mixture componentes >= 2.}

\item{starting_seed}{Starting seed for the algorithm. If not specified by the user, uses a random integer between 1 and 2^28 This way we ensure, when the user sets a seed in R, that this is passed into the C++ code.}

\item{better_initial_values}{A logical value indicating if the algorithm should search for better initial values of the EM algorithm. Recommended to leave it to TRUE, always, since the computational cost is very small.}

\item{number_em_search}{Number of different EM's to search for maximum likelihoods. Recommended to leave, at least, at 100.}

\item{iteration_em_search}{Number of iterations for each of the EM's used to find the maximum likelihoods. Recommended to leave at small values, such as from 1 to 5.}

\item{...}{Not currently used, but required for extensibility.}
